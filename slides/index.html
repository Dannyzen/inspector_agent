					<h1>Inspector Agent</h1>
					<p>A multi-agent system for network security</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p>How can we proactively monitor a system for malicious network activity?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Solution</h2>
						<p>A multi-agent system built with the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) that can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Inspect network connections</li>
							<li>Analyze processes for threats</li>
							<li>Provide interactive remediation</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Agentic Architecture</h2>
						<p>The Inspector Agent is composed of multiple specialized agents that work together:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Inspector:</b> Monitors network connections.</li>
							<li><b>Threat Analyzer:</b> Assesses the risk of each process using a rules-based engine.</li>
							<li><b>Remediation Tool:</b> Kills processes that are deemed high-risk.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>How it Works</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>The `Inspector` agent scans for listening processes.</li>
							<li>The `ThreatAnalyzer` agent assesses the risk of each process using a set of predefined rules.</li>
							<li>If a threat is detected, the `Remediation` tool is used to kill the process.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Live Terminal Output</h2>
						<p>The agent provides clear, table-formatted output in the terminal.</p>

						<h2>Novel ADK Implementation</h2>
						<p>The Inspector Agent demonstrates several key features of the ADK:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Multi-Agent Systems:</b> The agent is composed of multiple specialized agents that collaborate to solve a complex problem.</li>
							<li><b>Stateful Agents:</b> The agent uses session state to track processes and maintain a history of network activity.</li>
							<li><b>Tool Use:</b> The agent uses a custom tool to interact with the system and remediate threats.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Multi-Agent Collaboration</h2>
						<p>The `InspectorAgent` is a `SequentialAgent` that orchestrates the workflow between the `Inspector` and `ThreatAnalyzer` agents. This demonstrates how the ADK can be used to build complex systems from smaller, reusable components.</p>
						<p>The `SequentialAgent` ensures that the agents are executed in a specific order, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the `inspector_agent`. The `Inspector` must run first to gather the process information, which is then passed to the `ThreatAnalyzer` for analysis.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Stateful Process Tracking</h2>
						<p>The `Inspector` agent uses the `context.session.state` to keep track of the processes it has already seen. This allows it to only report on new processes, which is a more efficient way to monitor for threats.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Dynamic Remediation</h2>
						<p>The `ThreatAnalyzer` agent uses the `remediation_tool` to kill processes that are deemed high-risk. This demonstrates how the ADK can be used to build agents that can not only reason about problems, but also take action to solve them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Agent Types</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>`BaseAgent`:</b> The `Inspector` is a `BaseAgent`, which is the simplest agent type. It's used for simple, single-purpose tasks like scanning for processes.</li>
							<li><b>Rules-Based Agent:</b> The `ThreatAnalyzer` is a standard Python class that uses a dictionary of rules to identify threats. This is a simple and effective approach for known threats.</li>
							<li><b>`SequentialAgent`:</b> The `InspectorAgent` is a `SequentialAgent`, which is used to orchestrate a series of sub-agents. This allows us to create a complex workflow from smaller, reusable components.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How to Use It</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Start the agent: <code>./.venv/bin/python3 main.py</code></li>
						<li>Simulate a threat: <code>nc -l 8083</code></li>
						<li>Observe the output in the agent's terminal as the threat is detected and remediated.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Detecting and killing a malicious process that has opened a port.</li>
						<li>Identifying and whitelisting a legitimate process that is not yet known to the system.</li>
						<li>Monitoring a server for unauthorized services.</li>
					</ul>
